# Mani-Compiler
M치ni Compiler. Here we use and abuse java, to compile M치ni.

## How to use?

1) Copy all your M치ni files to [resources](https://github.com/crazywolf132/Mani-Compiler/tree/master/src/main/resources)
2) Follow instructions inside the resources folder.
3) Ensure all code is run under `STRICT;` mode.
4) Run `./Gradle build` or equivalent on your system.
5) Find your compiled Java Jar in `builds/libs`
6) Run as normal Java program.

## Why use this over normal Java?

One of the best reasons to use this over normal Java is... The fact you don't need to follow the strict rules of JAVA
such as, Defining what a variable is. (eg. String, Int. etc).
You get to use the lazy syntax of M치ni, such as importing and variable declaration.
